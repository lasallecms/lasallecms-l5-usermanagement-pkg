USER MANAGEMENT AND AUTHENTICATION IS SO BESPOKE THAT IT IS NOT PART OF LASALLE's FORM AUTOMATION.

## User's "Enabled for 2FA" setting (and database field)
 
You can disable 2FA for front-end, and for admin, login. However, you may want specific users to still go through the 2FA process when logging in. For such users, there's a field in the users table for this, which you can set in the admin.
